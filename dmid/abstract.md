# Abstract

This report aims to provide a detailed and comprehensive overview of the
current state of diffusion models, a type of generative model that has
gained popularity over the past few years.
The foundations of the theory behind diffusion models, particularly
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), is seen in depth along
with the most important improvements made to them.
To illustrate the theory and to be able to visualise the performance of
diffusion models, a Jupyter Notebook is provided with a practical
implementation of a simple DDPM using PyTorch. Overall, the reader will
be able to understand the theory, visualise the model, be able to
implement it, comprehend the improvements and the reasons behind them
and observe the difference in performance between the different models,
so as to have an understanding of the current progress made in the field
of diffusion models.
